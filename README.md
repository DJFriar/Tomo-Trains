Train Management System for Tomo coding skills demonstration. Created by Tommy Craft.

## How To Use

## Dev Notes

- A Postman collection has been provided in the root folder for your convenience.
- I added two endpoints beyond the requirements to handle adding and removing sample data for quicker manual testing.
- Running the test script will add a TEST train to the system.
- Data doesn't persist if the server is restarted.
